Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This is a command-line application built from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Purpose

View and manage the departments, roles, and employees for your company
